## My process

I learned a lot while creating this layout because I could practice using ":root" and "Grid Layout".

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid Layout
- CSS transitions
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.
- [:root](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/:root) - The :root CSS pseudo-class equates to the root of a tree, which in turn represents the document. Applied in HTML, :root represents the html> and is identical to the specific element and is more specific to html, except that its html.
- [CSS transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) - CSS transitions provide a way to control the speed of an animation when CSS properties change. Instead of a property taking effect immediately, you can make changes to a property occur over a period of time. For example, if you change the color of an element from white to black, the change is instantaneous. Using CSS transitions, the changes happen in a time interval that follows an acceleration curve, and all can be customized.
